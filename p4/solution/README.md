Stride scheduling allocates CPU time based on assigned tickets. Stride scheduling can easily support priority differentiation among processes. Higher priority processes can be assigned more tickets, leading to smaller strides and more frequent CPU allocations. And Stride scheduling adapts better to dynamic changes in workload, as processes can enter or leave the system with minimal effect on overall CPU time distribution.
In contrast, Round Robin does not inherently support priorities. Adding priority to RR often requires additional mechanisms, which can increase complexity. And Round Robin’s fixed time-slice approach can be less efficient when processes frequently enter or exit the system.



When new processes enter, the total ticket count increases, affecting all processes’ strides, which means the scheduler recalculates the distribution of CPU time. However, each process still receives CPU time proportionally to its ticket count. As processes join or exit, the stride values dynamically adapt to maintain proportionality. Processes with many tickets (high priority) will maintain frequent access to the CPU, while low-ticket processes experience an increase in wait times as higher-priority processes dominate scheduling.
Unlike Round Robin, where all processes would experience similar delays with an increase in the number of processes, in stride scheduling, only lower-priority processes experience longer delays. In Round Robin, adding more processes lengthens the time it takes for each process to get its turn, potentially impacting latency-sensitive applications.
