Materials
We will be using the free OS textbook Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces. You can also buy a printed copy if you like from the same website.

For the programming projects, there are two textbooks that are recommended but not required

The C Programming Language (2nd ed.): A book written by the people who invented C
Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (2nd ed.): This is a complete guide to programming in the Unix environment and is useful if you want to become a Unix expert.
Pre-requisites
This course assumes familiarity with basic computer organization (e.g., processors, memory, and I/O devices as covered in CS354) and data structures (e.g., stacks and hash tables as covered in CS367). You will need to be able to program in C (not C++, not Java, not Python, not Javascript, not Ruby, etc.) to perform the assignments in the course. We will spend some time covering background, but learning C on your own is important and valuable.# UW-Madison-Comp537
